## Overview

This project examines discount rate patterns across major grocery vendors to understand trends in pricing strategies within the competitive grocery market. By analyzing monthly discount data from vendors, we aim to identify how different grocery stores approach discounting and the possible effects on consumer decision-making. A key aspect of this analysis is exploring Simpson's Paradox, where aggregated discount data may obscure vendor-specific trends. The results provide insights beneficial for consumers, retailers, and policymakers by shedding light on grocery discount dynamics.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/simulated_data` contains the simulated grocery prices data.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, test and clean data.

## Statement on LLM usage

In developing this analysis, large language models (LLMs) were used to assist with generating written explanations and structuring documentation, including this README. The LLM contributions included generating descriptions of the data analysis workflow, highlighting key findings, and drafting sections for clear communication. All technical data processing, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results were conducted independently by the researchers using industry-standard tools and methodologies.The entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
